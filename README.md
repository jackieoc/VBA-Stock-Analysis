# VBA-Stock-Analysis
In this challenge we were asked to analyze the changes in stock price for three years, based on percentage and volume. 
The stock was shown as an alphabetical ticker which named each company.
We had to find the greatest percentage increase and the greatest percentage decrease.
A summary table was created to show the results.
The script created had to loop through all three worksheets.
Conditional formatting was used to reflect each cells outcome: green for positive, red for negative.
